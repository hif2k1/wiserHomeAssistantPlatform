# Interacting with custom schedules using the Lovelace UI

------
by @phixion

One question popped on the thread was how to switch between different schedules using the UI. This pattern shows how this can be implemented so that you have different schedules and can switch between them in an instant!

Alas there is no way to view the schedules in HomeAssistant, a PR for this would be very welcome!



1. Create a script in Home Assistant

2. Create a card in lovelace

3. Which will eventually look like this on lovelace
