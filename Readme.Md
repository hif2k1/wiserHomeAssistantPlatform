# Wiser Home Assistant Integration v3.0.24Beta

**BETA WARNING: this 3.0.24Beta release contains a significant amount of changes to support Lights and Shutters for the European version of the Wiser Hub.  It equally uses v0.0.27 of the WiserHeatAPIv2, which also contains a significant amount of changes.  It has been tested but may contain some bugs in existing or new functionality.  Use in your live environment at your own risk.**

This repository contains a Home Assistant component + platforms, for the awesome Drayton Wiser Heating solution.  It also supports the European version of the Wiser Hub under the Schneider Electric brand, including support for lights and blinds.

For the latest version of the Wiser Home Assistant Platform please use the master branch or better still install via HACS. if you want bleeding edge then checkout the dev branch, or look out for beta releases via HACS. Depending on what you choose you may need to use the Manual Code Installation described below.

## Minimum Requirements

Requires a minimum of HA 2021.12.  This is needed to support the new button functionality and changes to config flow.
Requires the new WiserHeatAPIv2 api.


## Updating to v3.0 from v2.x - IMPORTANT PLEASE READ!

Some of the great new functionality below has only been possible by making some major changes to the integration code and how HA entities are registered.  As such, when upgrading a number of existing entities in v2 will be replaced with new ones and the old ones will show unavailable.

If you have custom scripts or automations for this integration, they are likely to break.  Equally, your Lovelace dashboards will also need updating with the new entities.

We have tried hard to find a way to not have this as such a disruptive change but are unable to do so.  As such, please understand you may have quite a bit of work to reset your setup after upgrading to this.

In most cases, it will be easier to remove the old integration and add this from new.

However, we hope that many of the things our community has had to create with scripts or automations will now have a much simpler way to do it anyway and we can better maintain this setup going forward so future upgrades will be straight forward.


## Issues and Questions

As you can see, we have been oh so very busy adding new functions and trying to make it simple and intuitive.  We have done a lot of testing on this v3.0 release but as always, it is very hard to test all the possible setups out there.

As such, if you find an issue or have a how do I question, please feel free to raise a github issue on our repo or post you query to our HA Community page.

NOTE: It can really help diagnose an issue to be provided with an output from your hub to run in our mock hub server.  The integration has a service to create this in 3 files with all sensitive information anonymised to allow upload to our github issues tracker.  Please see [here](#providing-your-hub-output-as-json-files) how to run this.

# Code Installation

We highly recommend using [HACS Home Assistant Community Store](https://github.com/hacs), for more information on how to install HACS please see their documentation website at https://hacs.xyz/

## Manual Code Installation

This method is best used when you want to play with the "latest and greatest" from the repository. Moving forward (post 1.9) , the github repository will contain two primary branches, **master** and dev. Master is the latest released, and hopefully most stable branch, whereas **dev** is the branch that we're currently working on.


1. On your server clone the github repository into a suitable directory using the following command
   git clone https://github.com/asantaga/wiserHomeAssistantPlatform.git

2. Switch to either the master or dev branch as per your requirements. 
   e.g.
   `git checkout master`
   or 
   `git checkout dev`

3. Create a `custom_components` directory within your Home Assistant directory config directory

4. Within the custom components directory copy the wiser folder, from the directory where you github cloned the wiser component, to your installations ```custom components``` directory.


# Configuration


## Find your HeatHub Secret key
Reference https://it.knightnet.org.uk/kb/nr-qa/drayton-wiser-heating-control/#controlling-the-system

Before you can use the component you need to find the HeatHub secret key, this involves a couple of steps.


1. On your hub, press the setup button and the led should flash.
2. Use your phone or tablet and connect to the wifi SSID (you should now see available) that is Wiserxx_xxxxxx
3. Once connected to this wifi network, open your browser and go to http://192.168.8.1/secret 1.
4. You can then copy your key to an email to send to another device or copy and paste into the HA config if setting up integration via your phone/tablet.
5. When finished, either wait for hub to revert to led on constant or repower it (quicker to repower). Must be in non flashing mode to setup integration.

6. Configure using Home Assistant Configuration -> Integrations where your hub should have been auto discovered

![](docs/discovery.PNG)




## Config Options
Select the configure link from the integrations page.  This will then show the config screen - now configure it appropriately.

![](docs/config.PNG)

`Default Heating Boost Temperature` is the delta temperature above the current room temperature the radiator should be set to when boosted, default is 2

`Default Heating Boost Duration` is the time (in minutes) for which a heating boost should be active for, default is 60 mins

`Default Hot Water Boost Duration` is the time (in minutes) for which a hot water boost should be active for, default is 60 mins

`Scan Interval` is the interval in second that the integration will update form the hub.  Do not set this too low as the hub will not be able to cope and you will see errors.  Default is 30.

`Enable Moments Buttons` is to create buttons for Moments you have setup on the wiser app.  Default is unticked.

`Enable LTS Sensors` is to create sensors for LTS for rooms and hub heating and hot water demand.  Default is unticked.

`Setpoint Mode` modifies the way setpoint works. There are 3 options:
  - Normal - the functionality is the same as the Wiser app
  - Boost - when you set a new setpoint it will only take affect for the default "boost" time.
  - Boost Only in Auto - same as the boost mode but will only do this if in auto mode.  In manual mode, it will set the temp as per default mode.


## Managing Schedules with Home Assistant

v3.0.23 deprecates previous different services for Heating and OnOff schedule types in favor of a single service for each of get, set and copy that works with all schedule types, including lights and shutters for the Continental European version of the hub and devices.


### Getting a Schedule
Use the service `get_schedule`

This will require you to provide the entity ID of the wiser device and a file to copy this schedule to.  Leaving the filename blank will place the file in your config directory in the format climate.wiser_roomname_schedule.yaml
It is recommended to create a directory in your config directory to store these.  
See below for information on selecting the correct entity.

Note : If you are running HA within a docker container then the directory will be absolute to the container, if you have mapped the config directory to a local directory then all is good but the directory name given to the service must be a docker container address.

E.g. if you specify the filename as `/config/schedule.yaml` then `get_schedule` writes the file into the directory within the container. Providing you have mapped the config directory (using the -v or volumes: in docker-compose) then you can read this from a host directory (e.g. /home/haconfig.

**Saving Multiple Schedules to Files**
The service supports the ability to save multiple schedules at once.  Select multiple entities and do not supply a filename and it will output the list of schedules based on the predefined name structure.

```
service: wiser.get_schedule
data:
  entity_id: 
    - climate.wiser_dining_room
    - climate.wiser_kitchen
    - climate.wiser_lounge
```

### Setting a Schedule
Use the service `set_schedule`

This will require you to provide the entity ID of the wiser device and a file containing the schedule.  
See below for information on selecting the correct entity.

**Set multiple entities from one file**
The service supports setting multiple schedules from one file.  List the entities in the service call you wish to set the schedule for.

```
service: wiser.set_schedule
data:
  entity_id: 
    - climate.wiser_dining_room
    - climate.wiser_kitchen
    - climate.wiser_lounge
  filename: config/schedules/summer_schedule.yaml
```

A good place to start is to get a schedule from a device and see the file structure.  You can add times and temps within each day as you see fit.  As file created using the `get_schedule` service looks like below:
```yaml
Name: Dining Room
Description: Schedule for Dining Room
Type: Heating
Monday:
  - Time: 07:30
    Temp: 21
  - Time: 08:30
    Temp: 15
  - Time: 16:30
    Temp: 20
  - Time: 22:30
    Temp: 15
Tuesday:
  - Time: 07:30
    Temp: 21
  - Time: 08:30
    Temp: 15
  - Time: 16:30
    Temp: 20
  - Time: 22:30
    Temp: 15
Wednesday:
  - Time: 07:30
    Temp: 21
  - Time: 08:30
    Temp: 15
  - Time: 16:30
    Temp: 20

  - Time: 07:00
    Temp: 19
  - Time: 10:00
    Temp: 17
  - Time: 16:00
    Temp: 20
  - Time: 23:00
    Temp: 15
Sunday:
  - Time: 08:30
    Temp: 21
```
If you are creating your own file (or editing one you have copied from a wiser device), you can use the 2 special day
names of 'Weekdays' and 'Weekends' instead of listing individual days.

For lights and shutters, you can also use the special times of Sunrise and Sunset.

e.g.

```yaml
Name: Test Room
Description: Schedule for Test Room
Type: Heating
Weekdays:
  - Time: 07:30
    Temp: 21.5
  - Time: 08:30
    Temp: 15
  - Time: 16:30
    Temp: 20
  - Time: 22:30
    Temp: 15
Weekends:
  - Time: 07:00
    Temp: 19
  - Time: 10:00
    Temp: 17
  - Time: 16:00
    Temp: 20.5
  - Time: 23:00
    Temp: 15
```
You can also use a mixture of these special day names and normal days to override a specific day (providing the specific days names are below these special ones!).
```yaml
Name: Test Room
Description: Schedule for Test Room
Type: Heating
Weekdays:
  - Time: 07:30
    Temp: 21.5
  - Time: 08:30
    Temp: 15
  - Time: 16:30
    Temp: 20
  - Time: 22:30
    Temp: 15
Weekends:
  - Time: 07:00
    Temp: 19
  - Time: 10:00
    Temp: 17
  - Time: 16:00
    Temp: 20.5
  - Time: 23:00
    Temp: 15
Tuesday:
  - Time: 08:00
    Temp: 21.5
  - Time: 20:00
    Temp: 18.0
```

For hotwater and smartplugs (to make reading the schedule file easier) you can use time and state keys like below.  Note for both hot water and smartplugs, the Type parameter must be set to OnOff in your file.
```yaml
Name: Hot Water
Description: Schedule for Hot Water
Type: OnOff
Weekdays:
  - Time: 06:30
    State: On
  - Time: 10:30
    State: Off
  - Time: 16:30
    State: On
  - Time: 22:30
    State: Off
Weekends:
  - Time: 06:30
    State: On
  - Time: 10:30
    State: Off
  - Time: 16:30
    State: On
  - Time: 22:30
    State: Off
Tuesday:
  - Time: 08:00
    State: On
  - Time: 20:00
    State: Off
```


### Copying a Schedule
Use the service `copy_schedule`

This will require you to provide an entity ID of the device to copy from and the entity ID of the device to copy to and will copy the schedule between them.

**Copying Same Schedule to Multiple Entities**
Providing the schedule type is the same, you can supply multiple to_entities and the service will copy to them all.


### Assigning a Schedule
Use the service `assign_schedule`

You can either provide an entity ID to reference the schedule attached to that entity or provide and schedule ID


### What Entity Should I Choose?
- Room heating schedules - use the climate entity of the room.  eg climate.lounge
- Hot water on/off schedule - use the Hot Water Mode select entity eg select.hotwater_mode
- Smartplug on/off schedules - use the Smartplug Mode select entity of the smart plug eg select.smartplug1_mode
- Lights - use the Light Mode select entity for the light eg. select.lounge_light_mode
- Shutters - use the Shutter Mode select entity for the shutter eg. select.lounge_blinds_mode


## Providing Your Hub Output as Json Files

The integration contains a service to make it easy to provide your hub data for us to test in our mock server for issues you are experiencing.  This can save a lot of back and forth if we can use your data to recreate a problem.  The outputs created have all sensitive data anonymised so you can be comfortable posting to our git issues tracker.

In order to create these files do the following:

1) In developer tools, go to services
2) Select the Output Hub Json Data to File service
3) Enter your Wiser hub name in the field Wiser Hub Name.  This can be found from Configuration->Integrations and is the WiserHeatxxxxxx name shown on the integration box for Wiser in this screen.
4) Select Call Service
5) This will output 3 files - domain.json, schedule.json, network.json in a directory wiser_data in your config directory.  These can be uploaded to an issue on github.


## Network Topology

With V1.9 for TRVs you can now determine if the TRV is connected to the heathub directly or via a smartplug repeater. 

Each TRV sensor now has three special network related attributes 

| Attribute        | Meaning                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Node Id`        | The node Id of the device                                    |
| `Parent Node Id` | If this value is zero (0) then the device is connected direct to the heathub. A non zero value points to the smartplug/repeater for which this device is being routed through. Smartplugs always have this value as zero |
| `Hub Route`      | Calculated convenience attribute which evaluates to either `direct` or `repeater` based on if the device is connected direct or not to the heathub |
| `Repeater` | Which actual device is acting as repeater |



## Battery Values

For each battery driven device sensor the following attributes are available `Battery Voltage`, `Battery Percentage` and `Battery Level`. From conversations with Wiser technical support they recommend changing the batteries for any TRV when it reaches battery voltage of "26" or *OneThird* battery level. Given that RoomStats do not need to drive a valve, their battery levels can be lower.

An obvious ideal candidate for a Home Assistant automation to remind you to change the batteries :-)

Note : If you power cycle your HomeHub, with more than a minute or so when it is off, we've noticed that the devices will not have the battery info for a short period of time (maybe 30mins to 1hr) , just wait and the battery values will appear.

Moving forward (post 1.9) there will be two primary branches, `master` and `dev` . Master will be the primary "production" branch and "dev" will be the branch used for development. Other branches will likely exist where we build code into and then merge into dev, which in turn gets merged into master when all is good and dandy.
